        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "   - Compiled languages are converted into machine code before runtime.\n",
        "   - Interpreted languages are executed line by line by interpreter during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to manage and respond to run-time errors, also known as excertion that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "   - Finally block in Python is a block of code that always executes even if error occurs in try block of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "   - Logging in Python is the process of recording events that occurs during the execution of a program. It stores information about errors, warnings, messages and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - __del__ method in Python is used to clean up when the object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "   - Import statements imports the entire module to the file.\n",
        "   - From ... import statements imports specific items of a module to the File.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "   - To handle multiple exceptions, a Try-Catch block can be used. If multiple errors occur, we can use a single try block with multiple catch blocks or a nested try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "   - The with statement in Python, when used with file handling, serves the purpose of simplifying resource management and ensuring proper cleanup, even in the event of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "   - Multithreading involves multiple threads running in a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing involves dividing a process by separating the CPU to process and run a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "   -  Logging provides structured information, including timestamps, module names, log levels, and even line numbers, which are invaluable for understanding program behavior, identifying errors, and analyzing performance. It also allows for flexible configuration, enabling you to direct logs to various destinations like files, streams, or even APIs, and control the level of Detail displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "   - Memory management in Python refers to the process of storing data and managing data in memory by Python automatically.\n",

        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   - The basic steps involed in exception handling in Python are Try, Except, else, Finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "   - Memory magagment is important in python for several reasons like, efficient Resourse Utilization, Prevents memery leaks, Improved Performance, Stability, and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "   - Try block contains the code which gives error.\n",
        "   - Except block runs when the code of Try block gives error and Except block handles that error.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "   - Python's garbage collection system uses reference counting as its main mechanism for memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "   - The else block is executed when the code of the try block does not contain any exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "   - The common logging levels in Python are Debug, Info, Warning, Error, and Critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "   - The os.fork() function and the multiprocessing module in Python both facilitate the creation of new processes, but they differ significantly in their level of abstraction, portability, and how they manage process creation and communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "   - Closing file in Python helps maintain data integrity, prevent resource leaks, and ensure the reliability of your applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "   - file.read() is used to read the whole file.\n",
        "   - file.readline() reads only one line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "   - The logging module in Python is used to track events and debug issues in your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "   - The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, and is frequently used in file handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "   - The challenges associated with memory management such as memory leaks, fragmentation, excessive paging, and crashes, which indirectly degrade system performance and stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "   - To raise an exception manually in Python, the raise keyword is used. This allows for the explicit triggering of an error condition at a specific point in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "   - Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows for improved performance, enhanced responsiveness, and better resource utilization by enabling concurrent execution of multiple tasks.\n"
